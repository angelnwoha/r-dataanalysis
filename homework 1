# I would tell them that at a basic level we have proved that there is a difference in turnout when voting is compulsory vs non.
# I would also tell him that a p value result less than 0.05 shows that there is evidence that the null hypothesis should be rejected.
# Since we have a p-value of 0.0003486, far lower than 0.05, there is strong evidence in support of our alternative hypothesis, that compulsory voting affects voting turnout.

# From this plot, we can see that countries with state controlled press have the both lowest turnout and the lowest average turnout.
# We can also see that countries with controlled but not fully controlled press have the highest minimum turnout.
# Countries with free press have the highest average turnout and the highest maximum turnout.
# Countries with state controlled press have the highest spread of voter turnout when compared to countries with different types of press.
